# 👋 Hi, I’m Tibor 

I build bridges between **business and technology**.  
With 9+ years in sales and strategy, I now focus on **AI, automation, and context engineering** to create real business impact.  

---

### 🚀 What I do
- **Sales Engineer mindset** → translate client needs into clear, data-driven solutions  
- **Prompt & Context Engineering** → design smarter AI interactions and workflows  
- **Automation & Decision Support** → help organizations save time, cut costs, and unlock new value  

---

### 🔧 Current focus
- **Data tools**: Python · Pandas · SQL (foundations, not coding for coding’s sake)  
- **Automation**: n8n workflows · low-code/no-code integration  
- **AI/LLMs**: Prompt & Context Engineering · applying AI in real-world scenarios  

---

### 📂 Projects (coming soon)
I’ve outlined a few project ideas, but I’m keeping things flexible — some will inevitably change or evolve along the way.
- 🟢 **Automation Demos** → n8n & AI workflow prototypes  
- 🟢 **Product data insights via B2B API** 
- 🟢 **Housing price prediction**
- 🟢 **US stock screener (fundamentals-based)**
- 🟢 **Trading strategy (price action, LIQ, IMB zones)**
- 🟢 **Churn prediction**
